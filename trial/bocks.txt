i dont think kids having tech is the problem. the problem is when parents act like tech is just

tech can be really fun and even helpful to use as a child so long as it's used wisely. i absolutely

I'm a nurse and it IS dangerous as shit. Most of our issues come from manufacturers
discontinuing essential consumables when they make a new model, even though the
old ones still work, or they will stop doing repairs and maintenance because oh look at
that we have a new model...
We just had our iMed pump manufacturer discontinue our particular IV line, and switch
us to a cheaper shitter compatible line that sucks air in through the side ports, as well
as discontinue the y- connectors that go with it. They want us to get the shits with the
older machines and upgrade to the new version to get usable lines again.
Another example is our thermometers. The probe covers for the older model were
discontinued so we had to buy all new thermometers. The old ones still worked, just
cannot be operated without the cover.

I wish car companies would take a page out of the avionics design book. Put the essential and

functions on a touch screen. Lights, wipers, climate controls, stereo controls, and gear
selection needs buttons, knobs, and levers for "eyes-free" operation. All other settings and
functions can go to the touch screen WITHOUT A WHITE OR BLUE BACKGROUND. Fucking

I like physically owning the movies you love.
I have friends who love the movie and watch it on Netflix whenever they can...... and then Netflix

means you get to keep it and cherish it forever.
And if you're on a plane, where the movie options can sometimes be garbage? A handheld
BluRay player is your answer.
Also I love the artwork of BluRay covers. Another reason to have a physical copy.

Trying too hard to make something impressive only leaves you with something that may look

I’m a millennial as well. I can’t count the number of miscommunications I’ve had with people
because a conversation took place via text instead of via phone. Or how many conversations
were drawn out for a half hour with useless back-and-forths, when it could have been a 2-
minute phone call.
The biggest issue I’ve had with this was with a boyfriend. We were together for years and
lived together, and he thought talking on the phone was weird. I would call him for
emergencies and he wouldn’t pick up because ugh, phone calls are icky. He would literally
forward my calls because talking on the phone, with me who he knew and lived with for years,
was weird lol. I’d get a flat tire and need him to pick me up, but of course he wouldn’t answer
even if I called 2-3 times. People who are allergic to phone calls irk me

Constant-Parsley3609 · 13 days ago
In many places (particularly America) "outside" isn't a place for kids anymore.
What parent is going to let their kid outside on their own and risk some busy body calling
child protection services?
And even if you could freely let kids play outside without constant supervision, where do they
go? We are increasingly building giant roads and plonking houses down miles and miles from
anything that child might be interested in. Where do they go when the nearest park or field or
forrest is miles away?
Add in the fact that kids will get told off loitering and it becomes ridiculous.
Parents aren't allowed to let kids out AND there's nowhere fun for kids to play AND they can't
stay in one place for too long. Even if a kid manages to ignore or overcome all of those
obstacles, who are they going out to see? All of the kids other friends are inside and probably
not living within walking distance.

Touchscreens in cars are a fundamentally bad idea & physical buttons (or similar controls) need

Distracted driving is at an all-time high. Touchscreen controls literally require you to take your
eyes off the road and can create a longer time of inattention due to their complexity.
I have an old-ass car with physical controls. I can do dang near anything (radio, climate control,

EV charging networks are extra infuriating. Not only do you need their app, but you can’t just

because it’s dramatically cheaper and more convenient to charge at home. Then when you
choose the pay as you go option you and just link your credit card; instead it fills an account
with money and will automatically fill that account with money when the account is running
low. So you are spending extra money for no particular reason.

Boomer joke for the boomer thread:
Three friends are in a hotel room in Soviet Russia.
The first two men open a bottle of vodka, while the third is tired and goes straight to bed.
He is unable to sleep however, as his increasingly drunk friends tell political jokes loudly.
After a while, the tired man gets frustrated and walks downstairs for a smoke. He stops in
the lounge and asks the receptionist to bring tea to their room in five minutes.
The man walks back into the room, joins the table, leans towards a power outlet and
speaks into it:
"Comrade major, we want some tea to room 62 please."
His friends laugh on the joke, until there is a knock on the door. The receptionist brings a
tea pot. His friends fall silent and pale, horrified of what they just witnessed. The party is
dead, and the man goes to sleep.
After a good night's rest, the man wakes up, and notices his friends are gone. Surprised,
he walks downstairs and asks the receptionist where they went.
The nervous receptionist whispers that KGB came and took them before dawn.
The man is horrified. He wonders why he was spared.
The receptionist responds:
"Well, comrade major did quite like your tea gag.”

that and it fixes the problem. It happened a couple more times after that, but not enough to
really be annoyed. Once we switched to A/C, the issue went away so we figured they fixed the
issue with a patch or something.
Winter 2020/2021 by this time, I'm working from home full time. I noticed it being colder than
it should one night. Reset the Nest like before. Issue came back a few days later. And then
again. Then I started realizing the heat wasn't kicking in much during the day. (I sat right next
to the vent.) Started having to reset the damn thing every few hours just to get the heat to
kick on. Everytime the unit would show 68 or 69 before the rest and 65 or 66 after the reset.
We went and bought a $25 thermostat from Home Depot to see if it was an issue with warm
air getting in behind the unit or something. The issue went away. My husband and I are half-
joke that it was a social experiment by Google.

I just moved into a new place. The microwave his wifi compatibility, I don't know what it's for

ibnQoheleth · 13 days ago
Hacking your microwave so I can give it a virus that means your food is either slightly
undercooked or overcooked, but never just right.

I hate my oven so much. It's a Jenn-Air fancy pants dual oven, stainless steel with a color
touchscreen.
When I open the door, steam comes out and covers the touch screen.
Sometimes it's just that I can't use the touch screen at that point until I wipe the steam off.
Other times the whole oven shuts down claiming there's some kind of internal fault. It thinks
multiple areas of the touch screen are shorted together. Which I guess they kinda are.
And the one time I used the self cleaning feature it cooked the internal electronics and I had
to have the entire board replaced.
Then there's the fact that everything you do with the touch screen has animations so it takes
me 30 to 40 seconds just to turn the oven on and set the temperature.

tipping has gotten out of control- coming from someone who relies on tips for income. it hurts
people who actually should be getting them because now people are extremely agitated about
any and all tipping. i was just at a music festival and the guy who exchanges your cash for drink
tickets (not even the person who pours the beverage) had an ipad with tip options starting at
18%

I'm always confused by the option to tip at the SELF SERVE frozen yogurt place. Wtf...
I'm also suspicious that it won't even go to the cashier, it'll just go to the owner because it's

nothing more, tip them 20% fucking what
alexrbrodie · 13 days ago
I went to a bar recently and the bouncer had an iPad with tip options for the entry fee.
Tipping should be reserved for products/experiences that require service or process like wait
staff, baristas, bartenders, etc.

When We Were Young? They wanted a tip for EVERY THING. The guy at the merch tent who

him (literally didn't have to take 3 steps) asked if I'd like to leave a 25% tip!?

I’m not downloading a fucking app to use your menu
brilliantpants · 13 days ago · edited 13 days ago
And I don’t need a goddamned app for every website, shop, or restaurant I visit. Please just
put your menu and hours on a normal website and stop tying to clog up my phone.
Edit: And Have a REAL website, not a Facebook page or Instagram account. Those might be
good in addition to your website, but if the only way I can place an order is through your Insta
DMs, just fucking forget it.

the Reddit mobile site is so annoying. It now constantly asks if you want to continue using
the mobile version or use the app. You used to be able to get rid of the notification but
they decided that was bad business. Now it pops up and scrolls you back to the top of
whatever subreddit you were browsing. Infuriating. I don't want your fucking app Reddit.

I work at a restaurant as a host and recently failed our secret shopper because I asked “how
many menus?” Instead of “would you like menus or the QR code on the table?” Most of the
time when I do remember to ask, people just look at me confused and say “3”. It’s great.
Edit to add: we don’t have the feature where you can order through the QR code. Just the
menu.
Secret shoppers are lame and when I initially “failed” I didn’t know we were supposed to ask
this, so I didn’t get written up or anything.
Our menus are at the front and it’s the hosts’ job to get the right amount before bringing the
guests to the table, which is why we ask how many are needed. This isn’t necessarily the way
all restaurants work, but this is what I was trained to do.
I am hoping to be promoted to server soon (they told me before the year ends) and if they
don’t by January, I will quit.

Magmorix · 13 days ago · edited 13 days ago
It seemed to become prevalent when restaurants started opening for dining in again
after 2020, so people were concerned with how many hands had touched their menus
before them and such.

This, but for everything. 75% of apps should just be a standard responsive website. It would
load faster, be usable across more devices, less work for the dev teams to maintain a
presence on all the app stores and update. I really think most of the time and effort put into
apps is to make them "sticky" and just more present on users devices, at the cost of just about
everything else.

That reminds me of a police video I saw years ago when Tesla's were appearing on the
roads, one got pulled over for some sort of "illegal modifications" or distracted driving law
after the cop saw the giant screen the driver was looking at. The driver was like no, this is
straight from the factory how it comes and convinced the cop there was no infraction.

This is just bad UI. Screens require us to take our eyes off the road - a recipe for disaster.
Buttons and dials? Only need one hand. Eyes on the road. I miss car radios with buttons and

Honda changed their radio volume control back to a button a few years ago because so

FaliedSalve · 13 days ago
I rented a Honda a few years ago. Took me 10 mins to figure out how to brighten the

My car has a dial. Takes 3 seconds to figure it out.

YES, and furthermore, they should be LABELED buttons. When I'm driving a rental car that's

And 99% of the time that’s all that’s required to skip the phone/email stuff. As someone

Having to create a username and password to join just about anything online is a royal pain in

Good gravy this got way more attention that I was expecting. I will check out Password Manager
seeing as it is highly recommended.
For the record-I often see boomers much more fed up with computer requirements that require
jumping through hoops more than younger generations. I don't think younger generations love
these irritating requirements but if anyone feels this is not a boomer opinion I really don't have
the energy or care enough to argue
zawica · 13 days ago
Make sure you have one upper case letter, a number, and a symbol, and it has to be 12
characters long, and it can’t be a password you’ve used in the last month, and we will make
you reset your password every month, forcing you to constantly come up with new passwords
you will never remember!
chameleiana · 13 days ago
Don't forget that even if you've ticked the box to remember you, we'll randomly log you

Arrent · 13 days ago
The worst part is that most of these practices don't even matter. They do little to help, and
heavily encourage really poor password security behavior.
Thank god for password managers. The important thing is having random, diverse
passwords and not sharing passwords between websites, which my password manager
makes effortless. MFA is also really great, but I only use it on accounts I care about.
TiredOfDebates · 13 days ago
Password hell.
You practically have to have a password manager application to have secure passwords
working in IT. Every password changes every 90 days, there are rules to ensure that you aren't
just adding an iterating number to previous passwords, special symbols, AND it's discouraged
to reuse prior passwords across services. (A popular form of "hacking" user names and
passwords is to get a database from a poorly secured service... IE: the web server for some
local pizza joint with a online ordering system with account info... and just try the same
username & password combos from Joe's Pizza on some banking website.)
claytondb · 13 days ago
Sometimes it's faster (and easier) to just plug something in, instead of dealing with bluetooth

The same applies to networking: WiFi is not a panacea, and it's very much worth your while
doing some cabled networking if you actually value your networked experiences.
hunter54711 · 13 days ago
Most petty thing that annoys me is almost all smart TVs have Ethernet ports but almost
every single one is limited to fast Ethernet which is 100mbps, meanwhile the wifi can go
much faster. I value my networking experiences and that's why I want to have a wired
connection. In addition a TV is probably the best case for a wired connection, it's
something that never moves and is static and is already tethered to the wall for power.
Your options for above fast Ethernet is WiFi or buying an Nvidia Shield Pro. How much can
gigabit Ethernet cost in 2022?

One of my hobbies is computer gaming and I am not a fan of how everything needs to be

MaikeruGo · 13 days ago · edited 12 days ago
To add to this some cars won't let you manually select the input device from the stored BT
devices if you get going faster than 5 MPH and don't drop back down to a full stop—and in a
number of cars these systems have issues automatically selecting the right device if multiple
devices are stored as connections. Also, the audio quality is usually better when using wires
and there's no annoying weirdness of the car's BT supporting one set of codecs and one
device OS supporting another set that only overlaps the car's set with the worst possible
codec of the group.

ISeeDeadDaleks · 13 days ago
This is such a basic safety thing. Taking your eyes off the road to adjust the climate
controls, volume, whatever is so unnecessarily dangerous. I helped a family member buy a
new car recently and giant touch screens are inescapable. All the accident prevention
measures like automatic breaking are great - why can't we have the same safety-first
attitude with dashboard/console design?
dctucker · 13 days ago
I'm still baffled how touchscreens ever made it into cars in the first place. For drivers the
entire driving experience is intended to be tactile so they can keep their eyes on the road,
and we have years of design research within and outside of the automotive industry that
validate this. Expecting the driver to use a touchscreen to operate the audio and
thermostat is about as responsible as installing a hotel elevator without Braille legends...
the driver will sometimes be the only person in the vehicle who can operate these controls,
just as a blind person will sometimes be the only person in the elevator.

I worked in a store recently that had control over the music volume. Myself & coworkers

fucking hear me, they can’t be helped. Like??? Leave music at a normal enjoyable level.
Project_XXVIII · 13 days ago
Weddings, parties, stores, just about everywhere. If we’re going to a concert, then crank it. If
the music is to “enhance the experience”, and instead it’s just drowning it in noise pollution,
then there’s a failure in execution.
