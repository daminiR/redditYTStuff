My father-in-law is very smart, went to MIT and Cal Tech, founded and sold several businesses, published books that are still in circulation, holds several patents and now is working in the immunotherapy space.

Anyway I’m just a typical Midwestern State College grad, and the things I’ve learned about cancer and the various treatments from him are amazing. These are technical, medical, biological concepts that I could learn if I read 100 books. But he can somehow explain them in such a simple and relatable terms I feel like I really understand. It’s a gift of genius.

In that one moment I was like Jason fucking Silva.

Favorite line I got from a professor, that made me genuinely realize I can have my own thought, was, <break time="0.5s"/>“that’s a great question that I don’t know but we need to talk about.”

Conveyed immediate interest, but kept her same professional knowledge base which allowed me to explore my ideas with her. It really showed me what discourse is all about.
