To add, people who think they know everything are generally pretty stupid.

Smarter people will defer questions to qualified and experienced individuals because they are acutely aware of their own limitations, and that's what helps make them smart. They're not scared to admit they lack knowledge in certain topics or fields. And they will learn from that more experienced person to add to their library of knowledge and experience.

Stupid people don't know they're stupid, they think they know everything, and won't seek out more experienced people and admit to their limitations, admit they don't know fuck all about certain things.

The inability, or unwillingness, to change one&#8217;s opinion when confronted with new information. If a person just digs their heels in no matter how much they&#8217;re proven wrong on a given topic, they&#8217;re an idiot.

Well, opinon take time to change. Just because you are given new information, doesnt mean youre internally ready to shift your entire position. It usually takes time and a bit of self digging into a topic to change your opinion.

If your opinion ways as easily as you said, then you must not be very intelligent. Cause at that point you&#8217;re just following anyone who says it&#8217;s true. There&#8217;s alot of misinformation in the world so when someone isn&#8217;t something that they&#8217;re talking of, I presume them wrong, until I can see for myself. Otherwise mf could tell me a berry Im given isn&#8217;t poisonus, and then Id die because I ate it and turns out it was poisonous

Much of the time by my experience, it's them not WANTING to get the nuance of the point.

This is the big one for me. Being able and willing to break up the black and white of an issue into many different shades of grey, consider the relationship between those shades and with other colors, and then to form an opinion&#8212;based on evidence&#8212;without disregarding logical gaps, emotions, and the viewpoints of others shows immense intellectual strength.

But little concerning human psychology is 100% certain and even knowing this folks are still prone to reach unproductive conclusions, especially across society.

Are people here aware that troll farms are seeking to foster the exact opposite behaviors in reddit? They want to farm karma, spread favorable ideas, and break complex issues into more emotionally charged, polarizing sides.

For the last few years, it's been cheaper to buy a new car than a used one if you have to drive. Basically, take price / (200000-car mileage) / miles-driven-per-year.

Yeah, you have to keep it 17 years, but maybe they will. I ran the numbers on probably 150 cars before I bought mine and on a per year basis, was 70% of the closest used.

Cost-wise, if you can find a Ford Maverick at MSRP, and they turn out to not be badly designed, the price is amazing.

This reminds me of a book that had advice on how to write a novel. It said if people can't understand what you're trying to say, they'll need to make a decision: "Am I stupid? Or is this novel stupid?" Well, dear reader, we know that we're not stupid... So therefore, the novel is definitely stupid.

"How not to write a novel" - a hilarious book with excellent advice.

Not understanding analogies very well
    <break time="0.5s" /><mark name="COMMENT" /><break time="0.5s" /><!--User avatar level 2 SillyOperator &#183; 9 days ago-->

I was going to say just this. I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time teaching people and I find that I personally learn best when I &#8220;scaffold,&#8221; or relate things to experiences I&#8217;ve had before. A lot of people seem to find that helps too.

Another thing is that today we are blessed with so many wonderful content creators who are great teachers and find ways to simplify super complex topics in a way that is accessible to the average person, assuming no background knowledge.

But I think a MAJOR sign of intelligence is recognizing that analogies, heuristics, and simplifications by any other name are limited. Those clever analogies to explain how vaccines work, for example, are only going to get you so far. And unfortunately there were a lot of people making arguments against vaccines in terms of analogies and discourse just started breaking apart.

Honestly I think this is a pretty dangerous thing. There are too many people out there who think speaking in comparisons and heuristics is &#8220;good enough&#8221; for incredibly nuanced and sensitive topics. See J. B. Peterson

I thought this too for many years. About 10 years ago, I learned that this is a trait of many people with autism spectrum disorder. For many people with ASD, they simply cannot fathom that someone would not like the same things they like/keep things in the same places. It is not an intelligence issue for them. It is the way their brain works.

I've noticed that the dumber someone is, the dumber they assume everyone else is. Smarter people will often try to see the other side of an argument (assuming there's nothing else at play, like low self esteem). People with lower intelligence often assume that people who disagree with them are simply dumb because they imagine their arguments to be dumb.

Got in an argument on Reddit where they told me there was no way either of us would know something because we weren't scientists and because of that can't make any claims. When I corrected them that I actually was a published scientist that has taught for over a decade, they blocked me.

Edit: Since this has blown up, I just wanted add that I think scientific ignorance is the greatest threat to humanity and I'm open to any solutions. I dedicated a large part of my life to educating thousands of students, but I can't help feeling the problem is getting worse.

It goes back to curiosity.. It is more important to be factually correct than win an argument.
If someone is arguing with you, most intelligent people try to dissect what the other person is saying and want to figure out what they are missing in their own argument and fill in that gap to be correct moving forward, until they identify the error in the other person's argument and determine they are correct.

People who do very little thinking themselves often worry that everyone else thinks even less. That tends to surface in one of two ways: they join conversations and assume someone else is much less informed than they are (such as assuming somebody picked up an idea from a recent meme, without pausing to find out it was really that person's college major); or else they don't recognize critique (such as reacting as if someone who disagrees with Ayn Rand must not have understood her).

I think it's worth mentioning that a lot of this stuff preys on vulnerable groups of people, for example with regards to MLMs, they largely target young mothers from conservative cultures with no tertiary education who have been disconnected from the labour force for a long time. MLMs market themselves as a way for such people who often feel alienated from the professional workforce to be employed outside the domestic realm and to work with people like them. Imo joining an MLM is a very emotional decision rather than a logical one, which is why it can seem stupid when you don't resonate with those emotional needs because on paper it just looks like a bad deal.

Judging an idea or concept based purely upon some people who follow it, and not the concept itself.

For example, believing veganism as a concept is bad just because you had a bad experience with a vegan.

    It's subtle because people do this all the time with everything. Making arguments that mislead others by only showing the bad apples to support an illusion that the thing as a whole is also bad.

The inability to think from another&#8217;s point of view is a sign of low intelligence. Not understanding that people operate so differently from one another. Or that different people go through different walks of life, so they act and react differently.

    Close minded is the best way I can describe it. Someone who refuses to think about how others have approached a situation.
