<!--To add, people who think they know everything are generally pretty stupid.-->

<!--Smarter people will defer questions to qualified and experienced individuals because they are acutely aware of their own limitations, and that's what helps make them smart. They're not scared to admit they lack knowledge in certain topics or fields. And they will learn from that more experienced person to add to their library of knowledge and experience.-->

<!--Stupid people don't know they're stupid, they think they know everything, and won't seek out more experienced people and admit to their limitations, admit they don't know fuck all about certain things.-->

<!--Well, opinon take time to change. Just because you are given new information, doesnt mean youre internally ready to shift your entire position. It usually takes time and a bit of self digging into a topic to change your opinion.-->

<!--If your opinion ways as easily as you said, then you must not be very intelligent. Cause at that point you’re just following anyone who says it’s true. There’s alot of misinformation in the world so when someone isn’t something that they’re talking of, I presume them wrong, until I can see for myself. Otherwise mf could tell me a berry Im given isn’t poisonus, and then Id die because I ate it and turns out it was poisonous-->

Being able and willing to break up the black and white of an issue into many different shades of grey, consider the relationship between those shades and with other colors, and then to form an opinion—based on evidence—without disregarding logical gaps, emotions, and the viewpoints of others shows immense intellectual strength.-->

<!--I was going to say just this. I’ve spent a lot of time teaching people and I find that I personally learn best when I “scaffold,” or relate things to experiences I’ve had before. A lot of people seem to find that helps too.-->

<!--Another thing is that today we are blessed with so many wonderful content creators who are great teachers and find ways to simplify super complex topics in a way that is accessible to the average person, assuming no background knowledge.-->

<!--But I think a MAJOR sign of intelligence is recognizing that analogies, heuristics, and simplifications by any other name are limited. Those clever analogies to explain how vaccines work, for example, are only going to get you so far. And unfortunately there were a lot of people making arguments against vaccines in terms of analogies and discourse just started breaking apart.-->

<!--Honestly I think this is a pretty dangerous thing. There are too many people out there who think speaking in comparisons and heuristics is “good enough” for incredibly nuanced and sensitive topics. See J. B. Peterson-->

That tends to surface in one of two ways: they join conversations and assume someone else is much less informed than they are (such as assuming somebody picked up an idea from a recent meme, without pausing to find out it was really that person's college major); or else they don't recognize critique (such as reacting as if someone who disagrees with Ayn Rand must not have understood her).-->

MLMs market themselves as a way for such people who often feel alienated from the professional workforce to be employed outside the domestic realm and to work with people like them. Imo joining an MLM is a very emotional decision rather than a logical one, which is why it can seem stupid when you don't resonate with those emotional needs because on paper it just looks like a bad deal.-->

<!--The inability to think from another’s point of view is a sign of low intelligence. Not understanding that people operate so differently from one another. Or that different people go through different walks of life, so they act and react differently.-->
