Touchscreens in cars are a fundamentally bad idea and physical buttons (or similar controls) need to be brought back.

Distracted driving is at an all-time high. Touchscreen controls literally require you to take your eyes off the road and can create a longer time of inattention due to their complexity.

I have an old-ass car with physical controls. I can do dang near anything (radio, climate control, etc.) without taking my eyes off the road and in much less time.
			<!--Ron497 · 3 days ago-->

Add in the number of monster trucks that are the size of a tank and the number of ridiculously souped up chargers and mustangs, and we are seeing record numbers of car related fatalities in the U.S. Speed and size and distraction kill. And we’re too busy trying to get half of America to comprehend that climate change exists, so even though it’s election season, nobody talks about distracted driving or our obsession with car culture in America.

Dude for real, I hate having to go through 5 minutes of menus just for it to connect me to a person anyway, and then they have to transfer me 3 times. What purposes does it even serve?User avatar
<!--level 3 JoePizza22 · 3 days ago-->

The purpose is to annoy people to the point where they give up and decide it isn't worth it, that way the company has to deal with fewer problems and spend less money. Also a lot of people are idiots and will call customer services about things that could be solved in 5 seconds by Googling or reading information on the website.

			<!--thor454 · 3 days ago-->

And then that person hardly speaks your native language and also couldn't afford or even have whatever service or product you're calling about coupled with zero shared life experiences make for some really daunting issues. Like if my problem wasn't a strange one off type situation I'd have easily figured it out via the internet or bull shit automation. Like once I bought an airline ticket for like 8 months out. Flight got canceled and they issued a refund finally by sending it to the bank account I used to purchase the tickets...I had closed that account and switched banks months prior they told me to just willy nilly ring up the bank as if I hadn't tried that. Bank said it'll be returned as they have no record of me at this point the customer service said its the banks problem and they wouldn't do shit. Because they said all you have to do it call the bank . as if they fucking know how the American banking system works in Bangladesh

			<!--Rainbow_mama · 3 days ago -->
			There’s a documentary on the company shein. I’m sorry I can’t remember the name of it but it’s about the working conditions of the people that make those clothes and it’s horrific. Also the environmental impact from fast fashion is so much higher than anyone would think.
			<!--SandpitMetal · 3 days ago-->

My wife and I were watching a Canadian TV show once where they go undercover to investigate different things (I forget the name, but they'd look into anything sketchy) and had an episode about SheIn and other fast fashion companies like them. Not only are they horrible working conditions and awful for the environment, but many of their clothes also contain toxic chemicals and heavy metals (and not the good ones like Iron Maiden, either). Basically by wearing their clothing, you are poisoning yourself.

			<!--User avatar level 4 Alleonh · 3 days ago-->

I have no idea. I never downloaded it. I just tried to look it up (oral b smart series) and it looks like a game that maps out your progress (so basically encourages you to keep brushing the full 30 seconds per “zone”). It’s completely redundant because it vibrates to let you know 30 seconds has passed. Who is going to pull out their phone, load the app and watch every time they brush???

That being said it does have a little box that mounts by your sink with a smiley face that frowns disapprovingly at you if you brush to hard. With a clock. So I guess that’s nice? I don’t fucking know man, the batteries went dead in it about a year ago and I never replaced them…. Just typing all this made me realize oral b is cramming way too much shit in their brushes.

I hate my oven so much. It's a Jenn-Air fancy pants dual oven, stainless steel with a color touchscreen.

When I open the door, steam comes out and covers the touch screen.

Sometimes it's just that I can't use the touch screen at that point until I wipe the steam off.

Other times the whole oven shuts down claiming there's some kind of internal fault. It thinks multiple areas of the touch screen are shorted together. Which I guess they kinda are.

And the one time I used the self cleaning feature it cooked the internal electronics and I had to have the entire board replaced.

			Then there's the fact that everything you do with the touch screen has animations so it takes me 30 to 40 seconds just to turn the oven on and set the temperature.

			The same applies to networking: WiFi is not a panacea, and it's very much worth your while doing some cabled networking if you actually value your networked experiences.
			<!--hunter54711 · 3 days ago-->

Most petty thing that annoys me is almost all smart TVs have Ethernet ports but almost every single one is limited to fast Ethernet which is 100mbps, meanwhile the wifi can go much faster. I value my networking experiences and that's why I want to have a wired connection. In addition a TV is probably the best case for a wired connection, it's something that never moves and is static and is already tethered to the wall for power.

			Your options for above fast Ethernet is WiFi or buying an Nvidia Shield Pro. How much can gigabit Ethernet cost in 2022?

			To add to this some cars won't let you manually select the input device from the stored BT devices if you get going faster than 5 MPH and don't drop back down to a full stop—and in a number of cars these systems have issues automatically selecting the right device if multiple devices are stored as connections. Also, the audio quality is usually better when using wires and there's no annoying weirdness of the car's BT supporting one set of codecs and one device OS supporting another set that only overlaps the car's set with the worst possible codec of the group.

I work at a restaurant as a host and recently failed our secret shopper because I asked “how many menus?” Instead of “would you like menus or the QR code on the table?” Most of the time when I do remember to ask, people just look at me confused and say “3”. It’s great.

Edit to add: we don’t have the feature where you can order through the QR code. Just the menu.

Secret shoppers are lame and when I initially “failed” I didn’t know we were supposed to ask this, so I didn’t get written up or anything.

Our menus are at the front and it’s the hosts’ job to get the right amount before bringing the guests to the table, which is why we ask how many are needed. This isn’t necessarily the way all restaurants work, but this is what I was trained to do.

I like physically owning the movies you love.

I have friends who love the movie and watch it on Netflix whenever they can...... and then Netflix removes it. And if it's a rare find, then you might never see it again. Owning a physical copy means you get to keep it and cherish it forever.

And if you're on a plane, where the movie options can sometimes be garbage? A handheld BluRay player is your answer.
