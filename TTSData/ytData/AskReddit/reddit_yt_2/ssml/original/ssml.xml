Music in bars is too loud.
(Edit to add that I've been a touring musician and live sound technician. I love music but it actually sounds better at lower volumes, and I want to be able to hear it in to my old age)

I want to find just one bar where I can talk to my friends without screaming

TV is getting too dark. Not emotionally - it is visually too dark and I can’t see it

Too dark and too quiet. I swear we have to turn the volume up like twice as loud as we have it normally to watch Yellowstone.

Better believe the commercials have plenty of volume though...

Not everything needs to connect to the internet or have an app attached to it. I just want my fridge to keep shit cold, I don't understand why we have to bring WiFi into this situation.
